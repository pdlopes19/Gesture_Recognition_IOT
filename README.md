# Gesture_Recognition_IOT

This repository contains the code developed in Python to support the article "Computer Vision and Gesture Recognition" developed in 2018, as well as the results achieved. The article can be accessed in the file "Gesture_Recognition_IOT".

Abstract - This documentâ€™s finality is to show the implementation of a gesture recognition system, what has as principal goal ally natural human body movements to information to be managed on houses, offices or meeting rooms, as well as this main pillars, the gesture recognition algorithms, based on the Python library OpenCV with focus on the hands gestures, and the communication protocols, implemented with MQTT, widely used on IoT applications. Through these was possible to recognize the gestures and ally then to the communication, creating a bond between the human body and the automation and comfort needs, on business and residential spot.
